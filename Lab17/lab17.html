  <p> I am not sure exactly what kind of job I want to do, but I think I want to be a vet, or have some sort of job that helps take care of animals. I love animals and I would like to help those who are sick and injured or in need of medical care.

  <p> I want to have a job where I can take care of animals and help the ones who are sick or injured and need medical care. My family has three cats, one of them I've had for three years and the other two are babies, both only one year old. There have been a few times where they had been sick, but during all of those times, they have been cured because of vets and other animal doctors. Now they are all healthy. The only reason I still have all of my cats today is because of those doctors. And because of this, I would like to help cure animals that are sick, and do the same thing that those doctors did to help my cats. </p>
    
  <p> I want to have this job as a vet or an animal caretaker because I love animals a lot and I want to help as many as I can because it would make me happy to see them happy. I want to bring that same happiness to other animals and pet owners </p>
