    <p> Everyone has something in their lives that brings them happiness, whether it be something small, or something significant that they do every day. I chose the sun to represent happiness because it is always shining and comes up every day. Some things that bring me happiness is being with my family, and seeing my friends. Even if it is something really small and could be percieved as insignificant to others, if it makes you happy, then it is enough.
