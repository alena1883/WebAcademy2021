  <p> Happiness is something that everyone should be experiencing in their lives. It is very important that we all have something in our lives that brings us happiness every day. I value happiness because it is something that motivates us to live every day, and it is what makes us enjoy life. Without anything to bring us happiness, we would lose interest in the things we usually love to do. Happiness is something very valuable in our lives. </p>
